A character template I made :)

To be able to use the infobox you need to use CSS snippets but I'm bad at explaining things so here is where I learned how to do it lol https://space-writes.tumblr.com/post/723210231049568256/obsidian-templates-for-writers

And I'll copy and paste it here too for ease I guess

How to use the CSS Snippets

The infobox snippet is part of the ITS theme if you use it, or you can install it seperately by doing the following:

Go to this link and download the 'Callouts.css’ file https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Snippets/S%20-%20Callouts.css

In obsidian, go to settings -> appearance -> CSS snippets, and open the folder with the little folder icon

Paste the 'callouts.css’ into that folder

Hit the refresh option in obsidian settings, and toggle the new snippet to on

it is now installed! any callout you insert with [!infobox] will now display with the infobox settings. if you want to tweak how it looks, you can poke around in the css file and see what happens
